# GhibliDb

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ghibli! This CLI Gem is designed to show you, the user, all the films of Studio Ghibli as well as some additional information for films such as a short description, who the director and producer are, when the film was released, and what its Rotten Tomato score is!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ghibli_db'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ghibli_db

## Usage

1. Move to the correct directory by typing ‘cd ghibli_db’ into the terminal

2. Run the program by typing ‘ruby bin/run’ into the terminal

3. You can end the program at any time by typing “end”

4. The program will welcome you, and ask if you would like to view the database’s films. Reply with “yes” or “y” to view the films, and “no” or “n”, to end the program

5. If you opted to continue, you will be shown a list of films with corresponding numbers. Simply type a number 1-20 and you will be shown information about the selected film

6. If you wish to view the list again, simply type “films”

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
